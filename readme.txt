Allows developers to search the contents of a plugin for a certain string or regular expression

== Description ==

This plugin allows developers to select from a list of installed plugins, and input a string or
regular expression that the plugin will use to search through the entire plugin directory for
and return results to the user.

This alleviates the frustration of having to search through several files in a plugin for a
specific function declaration or configuration variable.

1. Upload `search-plugin-contents.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
